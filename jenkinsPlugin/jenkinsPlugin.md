# UrbanCode Velocity Plugin
With this Jenkins plugin, you can run Jenkins jobs as a part of a deployment plan in UrbanCode Velocity. You can run jobs that will trigger the creation of a version in a Velocity Pipeline as well as persist properties on that version that can be used as input properties in other Jenkins builds. This plugin will pass along important data from Git to the Velocity Pipeline.

## Build
To build the plugin, simply run
```
mvn install
```
in the root of this repository. Optionally pass the `-DskipTests` flag to speed up the build by not running the tests.

**NOTE**: Must be built with Java 8\
**NOTE**: It's best to delete the `target` directory before building to avoid errors.

## Detailed Functionality

* **Posting job metadata to your Velocity instance -** As you create and edit jobs, the metadata for the jobs will uploaded including the names of the jobs as well as the names of parameters.  This is done so that the jobs can be invoked from UrbanCode Velocity within the Velocity security model.

* **Invoke jobs from Velocity -** An authenticated, encrypted persistent connection is established with UrbanCode Velocity so that you can trigger off jobs and pipelines with no special firewall configuration.

* **Updates status of running jobs -** You will receive instant feedback in UrbanCode Velocity with links to the execution.

* **Job Executions can create versions in Velocity Pipeline -** You will have the option to select Jenkins jobs as "input jobs" which will create a version with special properties that you can specify.

* **Detects quality data provided by IBM Deployment Risk Analytics -** If you use the capabilities found in the IBM Cloud DevOps plugin to provide data to IBM DRA, then this plugin will forward that data to your composite pipeline to visualize quality data across your whole suite of applications.
